# Rainbow - arbitrary function coloring in CPP

This project aims to implement arbitrary function coloring rules within CPP.
This is accomplished by using clang's Annotate Attribute, and allowing the user
to supply cypher patterns to reject call graphs that violate coloring
restrictions.

## Requirements
TODO write actual instructions

+ Build clang
+ Include the clang python module in your `PYTHONPATH`
+ Include path to `libclang.so` in your `PATH`

TODO - add better examples
